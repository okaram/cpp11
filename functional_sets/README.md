Functional Sets in C++
=====

This is an example of Functional Sets (of integers) in C++. A set is 
defined as a function that takes an int and returns a boolean, true if 
the element is in the set, false otherwise. See [this 
blog post](http://programminggenin.blogspot.com/2012/10/functional-sets-in-c.html)
 for more information.

there's the usual cpp and h files (functional_sets.cpp and .h), plus a 
unit-testing script with google test (test_functional_sets.cpp).
