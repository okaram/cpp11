=====

I'm trying out the new C++11 features. 

I have the following examples:
* [functional sets](https://github.com/okaram/cpp11/tree/master/functional_sets) which uses lamdbas and closures 
to implement sets as functions. A set is just a function that takes an 
int and returns true if the int is in the set, false otherwise. See 
[my 
blog](http://programminggenin.blogspot.com/2012/10/functional-sets-in-c.html).
